Right now I have two similar ideas that I am choosing between.







Idea 1: Much Cooler Skylanders

My first idea is to make a game where similar to a Skylanders, a physical object represents the character being used in the game. However, while skylanders just remain stationary on the pad, in this project, moving and rotating the physical character would also move the character in the game. There would also be pieces you could swap in and out such as a shield or an intercontinental ballistic missile launcher. I am also still deciding if this should be a 2d or 3d game. I am leaning towards top down 2d because I think it would make it a little simpler to program, but 3d might make more sense with a 3d physical object.

I have experience in Unity and game development, but I am mostly clueless in anything related to hardware engineering. I know I would use the Unity game engine to create the software part of the game because I have heard it is generally easier to communicate with hardware products with unity compared to other game engines. For the interchangeable parts, I was thinking of using magnets to connect them together. Nathan also suggested 3D printing the material and inserting the magnets in the middle of the printing process. He also proposed using an electrical circuit to differentiate between the different parts. I would use Wi-Fi to connect the software and hardware, and I assume I would use Arduinos and for location and tracking maybe IMUs, but I think I'll become more concrete on this as the class progresses and I try multiple differetn solutions.

Idea 2: Sailing Simulation

My second idea is similar to my first idea in that it’s using a physical object to interface with unity, but it’s a little more practical. You would have either a sailboat or some other big vehicle and you would learn how to use it. For example, on a sailboat there’s a gib and a rudder. Moving the rudder would move the boat on the unity simulation. If I wanted to go even fancier, I could make it the opposite way though where you control the boat from the computer and the boat reacts based on what buttons your pressing. Unfortunately, although I think programming the rudder directions would be fairly simple, I don’t know how to start with the mechanics of sending data from a rope and pulley to a computer. However it would use most of the a lot of the same techniques I mentioned in idea 1.
